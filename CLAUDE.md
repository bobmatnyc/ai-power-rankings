## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/aipowerranking
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework**: React

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics
