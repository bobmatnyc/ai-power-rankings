# Our Ranking Methodology

**How We Rank AI Tools**

Our ranking system is designed to provide objective, comprehensive evaluations of AI coding tools based on real-world usage and measurable criteria.

## Core Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Code Quality (30%)
- **Accuracy**: How often does the tool generate correct code?
- **Best Practices**: Does the code follow industry standards?
- **Security**: Are security vulnerabilities avoided?
- **Maintainability**: Is the generated code easy to read and modify?

### 2. Performance (25%)
- **Speed**: How quickly does the tool generate responses?
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and computational efficiency
- **Scalability**: Performance with large codebases
- **Reliability**: Consistency of results

### 3. Usability (20%)
- **Learning Curve**: How easy is it for new users?
- **Interface Design**: Quality of user experience
- **Integration**: How well does it work with existing tools?
- **Documentation**: Quality of help resources

### 4. Features (15%)
- **Breadth**: Range of supported languages and frameworks
- **Depth**: Sophistication of capabilities
- **Innovation**: Unique or cutting-edge features
- **Customization**: Ability to tailor to specific needs

### 5. Value (10%)
- **Pricing**: Cost relative to benefits provided
- **Free Tier**: Quality of free offerings
- **ROI**: Return on investment for teams
- **Support**: Quality of customer service
