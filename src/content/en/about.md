## What We Do

### 🔍 Comprehensive Analysis

We evaluate AI coding tools across multiple dimensions including technical performance, innovation, developer adoption, market traction, and business sustainability.

### 📊 Data-Driven Methodology

Our rankings are based on quantitative metrics from multiple sources including SWE-bench scores, GitHub metrics, funding data, user adoption rates, and qualitative analysis of news and product developments.

### 🔄 Regular Updates

Rankings are updated monthly with the latest data, ensuring you have access to current information about tool performance and market changes.

### 🌍 Community-Driven

We welcome feedback from the developer community and continuously refine our methodology based on real-world usage patterns and developer needs.

## Why Rankings Matter

In today's fast-paced AI development landscape, choosing the right coding tools can significantly impact your productivity and project success. However, developers face several challenges:

### Key Challenges

- **Choice Paralysis**: With dozens of AI coding tools available, it's overwhelming to evaluate each one thoroughly
- **Marketing Noise**: Vendor marketing often obscures real performance differences and limitations
- **Rapid Change**: New tools launch frequently, and existing tools evolve rapidly, making it hard to stay current
- **Hidden Risks**: Some tools may have platform dependencies, pricing changes, or sustainability concerns

Our comprehensive rankings cut through the noise to provide you with actionable insights based on real data and community feedback.
