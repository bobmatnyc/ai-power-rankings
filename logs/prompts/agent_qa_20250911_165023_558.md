## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test the newly implemented AI-mediated admin feature to ensure all functionality works correctly.

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
1. Admin Access & Authentication:
   - Verify /admin page loads correctly
   - Test authentication flow (should redirect to signin if not authenticated)
   - Verify protected API endpoints require authentication

2. News Upload & AI Analysis:
   - Test URL input for news articles
   - Test direct text input for news content
   - Verify AI analysis endpoint (/api/admin/news/analyze) works
   - Check that tool mentions are extracted correctly
   - Validate sentiment analysis results
   - Confirm qualitative metrics are generated

3. Ranking Preview System:
   - Test ranking preview generation (/api/admin/rankings/preview)
   - Verify current vs proposed rankings comparison
   - Check that major movers are highlighted
   - Validate score adjustments based on news sentiment

4. Version Tracking & Commit:
   - Test ranking commit endpoint (/api/admin/rankings/commit)
   - Verify version history endpoint (/api/admin/rankings/versions)
   - Check that each commit creates a new version
   - Validate version metadata (timestamp, user, changes)

5. Rollback Functionality:
   - Test rollback endpoint (/api/admin/rankings/rollback/[id])
   - Verify that rankings can be restored to previous versions
   - Check audit trail is maintained

6. Subscriber Management:
   - Verify subscriber email viewing still works
   - Test subscriber export functionality if present

7. UI Integration:
   - Test the unified admin dashboard component
   - Verify smooth workflow: News → Analysis → Preview → Commit
   - Check error handling and user feedback

TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
- All API endpoints should return proper status codes
- Authentication should be enforced on all admin routes
- OpenRouter API integration should work with the configured key
- Data should persist correctly (either in JSON or database)

Please run comprehensive tests and provide test results showing:
- API endpoint responses
- Authentication verification
- AI analysis output samples
- Version tracking functionality
- Any errors or issues found
