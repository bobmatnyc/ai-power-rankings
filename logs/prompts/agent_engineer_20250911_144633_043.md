<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Task: Ensure all environment variables load from .env files first
Agent: Engineer

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Fix environment variable loading to prioritize .env files
  Inputs:
    - Current database connection code in /src/lib/db/connection.ts
    - Migration scripts that use environment variables
    - Any other files accessing process.env
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - All files load .env and .env.local before accessing process.env
    - dotenv.config() called at the top of all entry points
    - Scripts work with variables from .env files
    - No hardcoded fallbacks that bypass .env files
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Test that env variables load from files
  Constraints:
    Security: Never commit actual credentials
    Architecture: Use dotenv package consistently
  Verification: Show env variables loading correctly from files

Required changes:
1. Update /src/lib/db/connection.ts to load dotenv at the top
2. Update migration scripts to load dotenv before any imports
3. Update test scripts to load dotenv first
4. Ensure drizzle.config.ts loads dotenv
5. Add dotenv loading to any other database-related files
6. Use consistent pattern: import dotenv/config at the very top

Test by showing that DATABASE_URL loads from .env.local file.
