## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Update the AI Power Rankings app to use port 3001 as the designated port, which is what was originally intended.

Tasks to complete:

1. **Update .env.development**:
   - Change PORT from 3003 to 3001
   - Update NEXTAUTH_URL to use port 3001
   - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to use port 3001

2. **Update scripts/dev-pm2.js**:
   - Change the default port from 3003 to 3001
   - Update any console messages to reference port 3001

3. **Update CLAUDE.md**:
   - Ensure all references show port 3001
   - Update the development server section to clearly state port 3001

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Check docs/WORKFLOW.md for port references
   - Update any other docs that mention the port

5. **Update .env.local**:
   - Change NEXTAUTH_URL to http://localhost:3001
   - Change NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL to http://localhost:3001

6. **Restart the server on port 3001**:
   ```bash
   pm2 delete ai-power-rankings-dev
   PORT=3001 pnpm run dev:pm2 start
   ```

7. **Verify it works**:
   - Test that http://localhost:3001 loads
   - Verify the admin dashboard works
   - Check that the database status loads correctly

Port 3001 should be the standard port for the AI Power Rankings development server to maintain consistency.
