# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:00:35 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The article ingestion preview is detecting tools correctly (showing 7 tools affected), but all the score changes are showing as 0.0. Fix the ranking calculation logic.

Look at /src/lib/services/article-ingestion.service.ts, specifically the calculateRankingChanges method. The issue is that it's not properly calculating score changes based on the article sentiment and relevance.

The method should:
1. Use the sentiment (positive/negative) from tool mentions
2. Use the relevance score to determine impact magnitude
3. Calculate a meaningful score change (not just 0)
4. Consider factors like:
   - Major funding rounds → positive impact (+2 to +5 points)
   - Product launches → positive impact (+1 to +3 points)
   - Negative news → negative impact (-1 to -5 points)
   - Relevance to determine magnitude (0.1 to 1.0)

For this article mentioning:
- Cognition's $400-500M funding (Devin) → should increase score by ~3-5 points
- Replit's $250M funding → should increase Replit Agent's score by ~2-4 points
- GPT-5-Codex launch → should increase OpenAI Codex score by ~2-3 points
- GitHub Copilot updates → should increase GitHub Copilot's score by ~1-2 points

Fix the score calculation logic to produce meaningful ranking changes based on the article content. The formula should consider:
- Base impact = sentiment * relevance * importance_score
- Scale to reasonable point changes (1-5 points typically)
- Ensure changes are visible in the preview
