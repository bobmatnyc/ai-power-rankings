# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:00:35 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Task: Review proposed PostgreSQL/Drizzle migration solution
Agent: Code Analyzer

Use think or deepthink to analyze the proposed migration from JSON to PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

Context from Research Phase:
- 12 core entities identified (companies, tools, rankings, news, metrics, etc.)
- Complex nested JSON structures requiring normalization
- 4-phase migration strategy proposed
- Strategic JSONB usage for variable data
- Neon PostgreSQL as target database

Review Focus:
1. Is the normalized schema design optimal or over-complicated?
2. Should we use more JSONB fields to maintain flexibility vs full normalization?
3. Are there simpler direct approaches vs the 4-phase migration?
4. Consider maintenance burden of complex relational schema vs JSON simplicity
5. Evaluate if Drizzle ORM is the best choice vs alternatives (Prisma, raw SQL, etc.)
6. Identify potential anti-patterns in the proposed design

DO NOT implement code, only analyze and review the approach.
Return: APPROVED / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT / ALTERNATIVE APPROACH with specific recommendations

Consider human vs AI differences:
- Humans often prefer simpler, more maintainable solutions
- AI tends to over-normalize and create complex schemas
- Balance between "perfect" normalization and practical maintenance
