## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Update the Partytown library from the old @builder.io/partytown package to the new @qwik.dev/partytown package.

Steps to complete:

1. First, uninstall the old package:
   ```bash
   pnpm remove @builder.io/partytown
   ```

2. Install the new package:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @qwik.dev/partytown
   ```

3. Update the copy-partytown.js script at /Users/masa/Projects/managed/ai-power-ranking/scripts/copy-partytown.js:
   - Change the import path from "@builder.io/partytown" to "@qwik.dev/partytown"
   - Update the path reference from:
     `path.join(process.cwd(), "node_modules", "@builder.io", "partytown", "lib")`
   - To:
     `path.join(process.cwd(), "node_modules", "@qwik.dev", "partytown", "lib")`

4. Run the partytown setup to copy the new files:
   ```bash
   pnpm run partytown:setup
   ```

5. Update any webpack config references in next.config.ts if needed:
   - Line 326 has a reference to @builder.io/partytown that needs updating

6. Clear the old partytown files and regenerate:
   ```bash
   rm -rf public/partytown
   pnpm run partytown:setup
   ```

7. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:pm2 restart
   ```

8. Test that the 404 error is resolved by checking:
   - Check if /partytown/partytown.js loads without 404
   - Verify Google Analytics still works

Report back with:
- Whether the package update succeeded
- If the partytown files were copied successfully
- Whether the 404 error is resolved
- Any issues encountered during the migration
