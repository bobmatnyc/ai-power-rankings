AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 15:37:54 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with javascript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: contexts, methodology, rankings, newsletter
- Focus on code analysis, pattern discovery, and architectural insights
- Prioritize documentation analysis for comprehensive understanding

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


I need you to perform a comprehensive audit of all 42 tools in our database to identify missing or incomplete information.

Please:
1. Read the tools database at /data/json/tools/tools.json
2. Check each tool for completeness of the following critical fields:
   - company_id (vendor/company association)
   - pricing information (in info.business.pricing_model or pricing_details)
   - website URL
   - description/summary
   - category
   - status
   - technical specifications (context window, languages, etc.)
   - business model information
   - metrics (GitHub stars, users, etc.)

3. Create a detailed report showing:
   - Tools with complete information
   - Tools missing critical information (especially pricing and vendor)
   - Tools with placeholder or minimal information
   - Specific fields that need updating for each tool

4. Pay special attention to the 7 newly added tools (IDs 36-42) as they likely have placeholder information

5. Group findings by severity:
   - CRITICAL: Missing vendor/company or pricing
   - HIGH: Missing technical specs or business model
   - MEDIUM: Missing metrics or detailed descriptions
   - LOW: Minor information gaps

This will help us prioritize what information needs to be gathered and updated.
