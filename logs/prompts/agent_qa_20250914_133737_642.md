## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test the newly implemented file upload feature in the Article Management component and verify the News Upload tab was successfully removed.

Testing steps:

1. **Restart the dev server** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:pm2 restart
   ```

2. **Test tab removal**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3007/admin
   - Verify only 4 tabs appear: Articles, Rankings, Version History, Subscribers
   - Confirm "News Upload" tab is gone
   - Check that "Articles" is the default active tab

3. **Test file upload UI**:
   - Click on "Articles" tab
   - In the "Add News Article" section
   - Select "Upload - File Upload" option
   - Verify a file input appears
   - Check that it accepts: .txt, .md, .json, .pdf, .docx files

4. **Test actual file upload**:
   - Create a test text file with some content
   - Upload it using the file input
   - Verify the file name and size are displayed
   - Check that the content appears in the preview area (for text files)

5. **Test the complete workflow**:
   - After uploading a file, add metadata (author, category, tags)
   - Click "Preview Impact" 
   - Verify the preview shows correctly
   - Click "Save Article"
   - Check if the article is saved successfully

6. **Check console for errors**:
   - Open browser DevTools
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify no console errors when switching tabs or uploading files

Report:
- Whether tab removal was successful
- If file upload UI works correctly
- Whether files can be uploaded and content displayed
- Any errors encountered
- Overall pass/fail status

Use curl or browser testing to verify functionality.
