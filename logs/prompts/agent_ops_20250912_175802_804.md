## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with python, javascript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: types, tools, power, methodology

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel (production on main branch)
- **PM2 Integration**: Use pnpm run dev:pm2 for process management
- **Cache Generation**: Always run pnpm run cache:generate before deploy
- **Pre-deploy Script**: pnpm run pre-deploy validates everything
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backups before major data operations


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Based on the research findings, create an executable action plan for enabling the Neon database.

Key findings:
- Database schema is ready in src/lib/db/schema
- Migration scripts exist at scripts/migrate-json-to-db.ts
- Repository pattern supports both JSON and PostgreSQL
- Currently USE_DATABASE="false" and password is placeholder

Create a step-by-step execution plan that:
1. Identifies the immediate next step the user should take
2. Provides exact commands to run
3. Includes safety checks at each stage
4. Gives clear success/failure indicators
5. Prioritizes safety and reversibility

Focus on practical, immediate actions rather than theory. The goal is to help the user decide whether to enable the database now or continue with JSON storage.
