## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Add a database connection indicator to the admin dashboard that shows which database environment is connected (Development, Production, or JSON files).

Tasks to complete:

1. **Create a new API endpoint** `/api/admin/db-status`:
   - Create file at `/src/app/api/admin/db-status/route.ts`
   - Return database connection information:
     - Database type (PostgreSQL or JSON)
     - Environment (Development/Production based on DATABASE_URL)
     - Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
     - Database name if using PostgreSQL
     - Host information (sanitized - don't show passwords)

2. **Add database indicator component** to UnifiedAdminDashboard:
   - Add to `/src/components/admin/unified-admin-dashboard.tsx`
   - Display in the header area or as a status badge
   - Show:
     - 🟢 Green dot for connected
     - 🔴 Red dot for disconnected
     - Database environment (Dev/Prod/JSON)
     - Database name
   - Style it nicely with Tailwind classes

3. **Fetch database status** on component mount:
   - Call the `/api/admin/db-status` endpoint
   - Update state with the database info
   - Handle loading and error states

4. **Environment detection logic**:
   - Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - If it contains "neondb" and "bold-sunset" → Development
   - If it contains other patterns → Production
   - If USE_DATABASE is "false" → JSON files
   - Parse the database name from the connection string

The indicator should be subtle but visible, perhaps in the top-right corner of the admin dashboard or as part of the header. Use appropriate colors:
- Green badge for Development
- Red/Orange badge for Production
- Blue badge for JSON files

Make sure to sanitize any sensitive information from the connection string (remove passwords, keep only host and database name).
