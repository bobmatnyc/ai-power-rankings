# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:00:35 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Based on the audit report, I need you to update the tools database with missing critical information. Focus on the most critical issues first.

Please update /data/json/tools/tools.json with the following:

**CRITICAL - Add missing company_id associations:**
1. Tool #36 (Trae AI) - Create/assign appropriate company
2. Tool #37 (Qoder) - Create/assign appropriate company  
3. Tool #38 (RooCode) - Create/assign appropriate company
4. Tool #39 (KiloCode) - Create/assign appropriate company
5. Tool #42 (Qwen Code) - Assign to Alibaba (company_id: 17)

**HIGH PRIORITY - Add pricing details for tools with pricing_model but no pricing_details:**
- Tool #4 (Claude Code) - Add actual pricing tiers
- Tool #5 (V0) - Add pricing information
- Tool #6 (Cline) - Add pricing details
- Tool #7 (Aider) - Add pricing information
- Tool #8 (Bolt.new) - Add pricing tiers
- Tool #10 (Marblism) - Add pricing details
- Tool #13 (Continue) - Add pricing information
- Tool #14 (Windsurf) - Add pricing details
- Tool #21 (Boxy) - Add pricing information
- Tool #25 (Code Conductor) - Add pricing details
- Tool #26 (Pieces) - Add pricing information
- Tool #31 (Kiro) - Add pricing details
- Tool #32 (Warp) - Add pricing information

**For the newly added tools (36-42), update with more specific information:**
- Replace generic placeholder features with actual features
- Add proper technical specifications where available
- Update descriptions to be more specific

Also, you'll need to check /data/json/companies/companies.json and potentially add new companies for the tools that don't have company associations.

Start with these critical updates, ensuring the data structure remains consistent with existing entries.
