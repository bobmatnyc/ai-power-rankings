AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: qa

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test the tool detection fixes that were just implemented in the article ingestion system.

Test scenarios to verify:
1. Run the existing test suite to ensure nothing broke
2. Create specific test cases for the new tool mappings:
   - Verify "GPT-4" maps to "ChatGPT Canvas"
   - Verify "Claude" and "Claude 3.5" map to "Claude Code"
   - Verify "Replit" maps to "Replit Agent"
   - Verify "Cognition" and "Cognition AI" map to "Devin"
   - Verify "Gemini" maps to "Google Gemini Code Assist"
   - Verify unknown tools like "GPT-5-Codex" are preserved as-is

3. Test the fuzzy matching:
   - Partial matches should work
   - Case insensitive matching should work
   - Multi-word variations should work

Provide test output showing all tests pass and the tool detection is now working correctly.
