<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with javascript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: contexts, methodology, rankings, newsletter
- Focus on code analysis, pattern discovery, and architectural insights
- Prioritize documentation analysis for comprehensive understanding

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

Task: Analyze current JSON data structure for PostgreSQL migration
Agent: Research Agent

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Analyze all JSON data files and identify schema requirements for PostgreSQL/Drizzle migration
  Inputs: 
    - /data/json/ directory (primary data storage)
    - /src/data/cache/ (generated cache files)
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - Document all data entities and their relationships
    - Identify all data types and constraints
    - Map JSON structure to relational tables
    - Define primary keys and foreign key relationships
  Known Limitations: JSON files may have nested structures requiring normalization
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Provide analysis report with schema recommendations
  Constraints:
    Performance: Consider query patterns for optimization
    Architecture: Follow relational database best practices
    Security: Identify sensitive data requiring encryption
  Dependencies: Access to all JSON data files
  Identified Risks: Data loss during migration, schema design flaws
  Missing Requirements: User's specific query patterns and performance requirements
  Verification: Provide complete entity-relationship diagram and migration complexity assessment

Focus on:
1. Rankings data structure
2. News articles structure  
3. Tools/models data structure
4. Translations and i18n data
5. Any other data entities found

Return a comprehensive analysis with recommended PostgreSQL schema design using Drizzle ORM conventions.
