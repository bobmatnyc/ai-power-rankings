## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


We need to import company data from JSON files to the database and ensure the application properly uses the database for all data. Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Create import script for companies**:
   - Read from `/data/json/companies/companies.json`
   - The JSON structure has: `{ "companies": { "0": {...}, "1": {...}, ... }, "index": [...], "metadata": {...} }`
   - Each company has fields like: name, slug, description, logo, website, etc.
   - Import all 63 companies to the PostgreSQL database

2. **Import to production database first**:
   - Production DB: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_3oQsxj0FcfKY@ep-wispy-fog-ad8d4skz.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
   - Use the companies table structure:
     - id (uuid), slug (text), name (text), data (jsonb), created_at, updated_at
   - Store all company fields in the data column as JSONB

3. **Update application code to use database**:
   - Check `/src/lib/db/repositories/companies.repository.ts` 
   - Ensure it's properly reading from the database
   - Update any code that might be reading from JSON files instead of DB
   - The app should use DATABASE when `USE_DATABASE="true"` is set

4. **Test the import**:
   - Verify all 63 companies are imported
   - Check that the data is accessible via the repository
   - Ensure the application displays companies correctly

Please create the import script and execute it on the production database. Then verify the application code is using the database properly.

TEST YOUR IMPLEMENTATION by:
- Running the import script
- Verifying companies are in the database
- Checking that the app reads from DB not JSON files
