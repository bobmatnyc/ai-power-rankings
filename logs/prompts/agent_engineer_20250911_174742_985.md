## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Remove OAuth authentication requirements for local deployment of the admin interface.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Modify authentication checks to bypass OAuth when running locally
2. Update all admin API endpoints to skip authentication in local environment
3. Allow direct access to /admin page without signin redirect locally
4. Keep OAuth enabled for production deployment (Vercel)

SPECIFIC CHANGES NEEDED:
1. In `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`:
   - Remove or bypass the redirect to signin for local environment
   - Allow direct rendering of UnifiedAdminDashboard

2. In all admin API routes:
   - `/src/app/api/admin/news/analyze/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/admin/rankings/preview/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/admin/rankings/commit/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/admin/rankings/versions/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/admin/rankings/rollback/[id]/route.ts`
   - Remove or bypass authentication checks when NODE_ENV !== 'production'

3. Create environment detection:
   - Check if running locally (development or localhost)
   - Skip auth requirements for local environments
   - Maintain auth for production

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use environment variables or hostname detection
- Add conditional logic: if local, skip auth; if production, require auth
- Ensure clean code without breaking production security

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Verify /admin loads directly without signin locally
- Test all API endpoints work without authentication locally
- Confirm data operations (preview, commit, rollback) function correctly
- Ensure production deployment would still require auth

Please implement these changes and provide test evidence showing:
- Admin page loads directly in local environment
- API endpoints respond without authentication
- Complete admin workflow works without OAuth locally
