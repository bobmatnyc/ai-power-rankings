AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: security

INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Perform a comprehensive security review of the AI Power Rankings project to identify any exposed credentials in environment files before any git operations.

CRITICAL: Scan all environment files (.env, .env.local, .env.production, .env.production.local) for:
1. API keys, tokens, and secrets
2. Database passwords and connection strings  
3. OAuth client secrets
4. Service account credentials
5. Any other sensitive data

For each file:
1. Read the contents
2. Identify ALL credentials found
3. Categorize by sensitivity level
4. Report which files contain secrets that should NOT be committed

Focus files:
- .env.local (should be gitignored)
- .env.production.local (should be gitignored)
- .env.production (can be committed if no secrets)
- .env (can be committed if no secrets)

Provide a detailed security report with:
- List of all credentials found
- Which files contain sensitive data
- Verification that sensitive files are in .gitignore
- Recommendations for securing the credentials

This is a MANDATORY security check before any code can be pushed to remote.
