## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


There's still a TypeError with toFixed in ArticleManagement component. Find and fix ALL instances where toFixed is called on potentially undefined values.

The error trace shows:
- ArticleManagement at line that corresponds to a toFixed call
- It's being called from UnifiedAdminDashboard

Search for ALL toFixed calls in:
1. /Users/masa/Projects/managed/ai-power-ranking/src/components/admin/article-management.tsx
2. /Users/masa/Projects/managed/ai-power-ranking/src/components/admin/unified-admin-dashboard.tsx

For EVERY toFixed call found, ensure it has proper null/undefined checks:
- Change: `value.toFixed(1)` 
- To: `value?.toFixed(1) ?? "0.0"`
- Or: `(value || 0).toFixed(1)`
- Or add explicit checks: `value !== undefined && value !== null ? value.toFixed(1) : "0.0"`

Also check for any numeric operations that might result in undefined:
- Division by zero
- Operations on undefined values
- Missing data from API responses

Make sure to fix:
1. All stats calculations that use toFixed
2. All preview calculations
3. All percentage calculations
4. Any averages or scores

After fixing, verify no other components have similar issues by searching for toFixed in all admin components.
