## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with python, javascript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: types, tools, power, methodology

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel (production on main branch)
- **PM2 Integration**: Use pnpm run dev:pm2 for process management
- **Cache Generation**: Always run pnpm run cache:generate before deploy
- **Pre-deploy Script**: pnpm run pre-deploy validates everything
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backups before major data operations


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


I need you to deploy the updated tools database to production on Vercel. We've added 7 new tools and updated pricing/vendor information for all tools.

Please:
1. First run the pre-deployment checks: `pnpm run pre-deploy`
2. Commit all changes with a descriptive message about the tools database update
3. Push to the main branch to trigger Vercel deployment
4. Monitor the deployment status
5. Verify the deployment completed successfully

The changes include:
- Added 7 new tools (IDs 36-42): Trae AI, Qoder, RooCode, KiloCode, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, Qwen Code
- Updated pricing information for 14 existing tools
- Added 5 new companies for vendor associations
- Complete information for all 42 tools in database

Make sure all cache files and data files are included in the deployment.
