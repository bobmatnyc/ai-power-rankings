<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with javascript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: contexts, methodology, rankings, newsletter
- Focus on code analysis, pattern discovery, and architectural insights
- Prioritize documentation analysis for comprehensive understanding

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings

Analyze the current database setup and create a comprehensive plan for enabling Neon PostgreSQL database integration.

Current situation:
- USE_DATABASE="false" in .env.local
- DATABASE_URL has placeholder password "YOUR_PASSWORD"
- Application currently uses JSON file storage
- Neon database code is ready but not activated

Tasks:
1. Analyze the existing database schema files in src/lib/db/schema
2. Check for any migration files or setup scripts
3. Identify what data needs to be migrated from JSON to PostgreSQL
4. Create a detailed implementation plan for database activation
5. List any risks or considerations for the migration

Provide a structured plan with clear steps, dependencies, and safety measures.
