<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with python, javascript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: types, tools, power, methodology

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel (production on main branch)
- **PM2 Integration**: Use pnpm run dev:pm2 for process management
- **Cache Generation**: Always run pnpm run cache:generate before deploy
- **Pre-deploy Script**: pnpm run pre-deploy validates everything
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backups before major data operations


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Set up a local deployment connected to the production database for testing the new code changes.

Requirements:
1. Check current environment configuration in .env.local
2. Create a backup of current .env.local 
3. Set up environment variables to connect to production database (Neon)
4. Ensure safety measures are in place (read-only if possible for initial testing)
5. Build the application for production mode
6. Start the server with production database connection
7. Document the commands and configuration needed

Safety considerations:
- Make sure to backup current configuration
- Ensure we're not exposing production credentials
- Consider using read-only connection initially
- Test carefully to avoid any production data corruption

Provide clear instructions for connecting to production database locally.
