## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test the AI news article analysis and rewriting functionality.

Context:
- The AI Power Rankings application has an API endpoint at `/api/admin/news/analyze` that rewrites articles in professional news style
- The API expects JSON with fields: `input` (content), `type` ("text", "url", or "file")
- Development server is running on http://localhost:3001
- The API should transform first-person promotional content into third-person neutral news style

Test Requirements:
1. Test the API endpoint with promotional/marketing content that needs rewriting
2. Verify the rewritten content follows professional news standards:
   - Third-person voice (no "I", "we", "our", "you")
   - Neutral tone without marketing language
   - Proper news structure with lead paragraph
3. Test with this specific content: "I am excited to announce that our company has launched an amazing new AI coding assistant. We think you will love it! This revolutionary tool will transform how developers write code."
4. Provide the actual API response showing the original vs rewritten content
5. Verify the API is properly identifying AI tools mentioned in the content

Provide actual test results with the rewritten content demonstrating the transformation from promotional to news style.
