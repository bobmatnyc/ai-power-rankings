# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 15:37:54 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with javascript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: contexts, methodology, rankings, newsletter
- Focus on code analysis, pattern discovery, and architectural insights
- Prioritize documentation analysis for comprehensive understanding

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

Task: Analyze current admin features and ranking system for AI-mediated redesign
Agent: Research

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Understand current admin system to design AI-mediated news/rankings feature
  Inputs:
    - Current admin pages in /src/app/[lang]/dashboard/
    - Ranking system in /src/lib/services/rankings/
    - News system in /src/lib/services/news/
    - Database schema for news and rankings
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - Document all current admin features
    - Understand ranking calculation algorithm
    - Map news data structure and metadata
    - Identify subscriber email access points
    - Define integration points for OpenRouter API
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Provide analysis report
  Verification: Complete architecture understanding document

Focus areas:
1. Current admin features to remove (keep only news upload & subscribers)
2. How rankings are currently calculated from news
3. News metadata structure and tool mentions
4. Ranking versioning/history capabilities
5. Database schema for tracking ranking changes
6. OpenRouter API integration points for AI analysis

Return comprehensive analysis with recommendations for AI-mediated workflow:
- News upload (URL scraping or text)
- AI analysis with OpenRouter
- Tool mention extraction and sentiment
- Ranking impact calculation
- Preview mechanism
- Version tracking for rollback
- Simplified admin UI
