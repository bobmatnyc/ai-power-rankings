## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Fix the remaining critical linting issues in the AI Power Rankings codebase that are preventing CI from passing.

## Remaining Issues to Fix

1. **Template literal issue** in `src/app/api/admin/news/route.ts:238`
   - Change string concatenation to template literal

2. **Remaining `any` types** in:
   - `src/app/api/admin/preview-rankings-json/route.ts:285`
   - `src/app/api/admin/rankings/route.ts` - multiple locations
   - `src/app/api/admin/update-site-settings/route.ts` - error handling

3. **Implicit any variable** in `src/app/api/admin/rankings/route.ts:566`
   - Variable `rankingData` needs type annotation

## Instructions

1. Fix the template literal issue by replacing string concatenation with template literals
2. For the remaining `any` types:
   - Import proper types from `@/lib/json-db/schemas`
   - Use proper type assertions where needed
   - For error handling, continue using `unknown` type with proper type guards
3. For the implicit any variable, add proper type annotation based on the data structure
4. Test your changes with `pnpm run type-check` and `pnpm run lint`

## Success Criteria

- All critical linting errors should be resolved
- `pnpm run ci:local` should pass without errors
- No regression in functionality

Focus on fixing these specific issues to get the CI passing.
