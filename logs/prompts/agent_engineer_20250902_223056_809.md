## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Fix the final 53 linting errors in the AI Power Rankings codebase to achieve 0 errors.

## Current Status
- Started with 320+ errors
- Fixed all `any` type errors  
- Now at 53 remaining errors (non-any types)
- Need to get to 0 errors

## Categories of Remaining Issues

Based on the previous analysis, the remaining 53 errors are likely:
1. `noNonNullAssertion` - Non-null assertion operators
2. `noArrayIndexKey` - Array index as React key
3. `useExhaustiveDependencies` - Missing React hook dependencies
4. `noDangerouslySetInnerHtml` - Dangerous HTML setting
5. Accessibility issues

## Instructions

1. **Run a fresh lint check** to see exactly what the 53 errors are
2. **Fix each category systematically**:
   - For non-null assertions: Use optional chaining or nullish coalescing
   - For array keys: Create unique keys from data properties
   - For React dependencies: Add missing deps or use useCallback
   - For dangerouslySetInnerHTML: Add biome-ignore if truly necessary
   - For accessibility: Add proper ARIA attributes

3. **Priority**: Focus on actual errors, not warnings
4. **Test after each fix** to ensure no regression

## Files Likely Needing Fixes
- Components with maps/iterations (array key issues)
- React components with useEffect/useMemo (dependency issues)  
- Content rendering components (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Library/utility files (non-null assertions)

## Success Criteria
- `pnpm run lint` shows "Found 0 errors"
- Type checking still passes
- No functional regression

Fix all 53 remaining errors to achieve a completely clean linting result.
