AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:00:35 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


I need you to add the following missing tools to our tools database at /data/json/tools/tools.json:

**Tools to add:**
1. **Trae AI** - https://www.trae.ai
2. **Qoder** - https://qoder.com  
3. **RooCode** - https://roocode.com
4. **KiloCode** - https://kilocode.ai
5. **OpenAI Codex** - https://openai.com/codex (Note: We have "OpenAI Codex CLI" with ID 24, but this appears to be different)
6. **Google Gemini CLI** - https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
7. **Qwen Code** - https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code

Please:
1. Read the current tools.json file
2. Add these 7 new tools with proper structure:
   - Assign sequential IDs (starting from 36 since current max is 35)
   - Use appropriate categories (ide-assistant, code-editor, autonomous-agent, or open-source-framework)
   - Set status as "active" 
   - Add placeholder info sections with summaries and descriptions
   - Include the correct URLs provided
3. Update the metadata section with new count and timestamp
4. Ensure proper JSON formatting and validation

For categorization guidance:
- Trae AI, Qoder, RooCode, KiloCode - likely "ide-assistant" or "code-editor"
- OpenAI Codex - likely "autonomous-agent"
- Google Gemini CLI, Qwen Code - likely "open-source-framework" or "autonomous-agent"

Make sure to preserve all existing tools and just append the new ones.
