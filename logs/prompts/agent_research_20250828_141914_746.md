AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 15:37:54 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with javascript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: contexts, methodology, rankings, newsletter
- Focus on code analysis, pattern discovery, and architectural insights
- Prioritize documentation analysis for comprehensive understanding

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


I need you to analyze our current tools database and compare it with this list of tools that need to be represented:

Tools to check:
1. https://cursor.com
2. https://windsurf.com
3. https://kiro.dev
4. https://www.trae.ai
5. https://qoder.com
6. https://github.com/features/copilot (GitHub Copilot)
7. https://cline.bot
8. https://roocode.com
9. https://kilocode.ai
10. https://www.warp.dev
11. https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code (Claude Code)
12. https://openai.com/codex
13. https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
14. https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code
15. https://aider.chat/

Please:
1. Read the current tools database at /data/json/tools/tools.json
2. Check which of these tools are already in the database (match by URL or name)
3. Create a clear report showing:
   - Which tools are already present (with their IDs and names)
   - Which tools are missing and need to be added
   - Any tools that might be duplicates or have different URLs

Focus on exact URL matches and name similarities. Be thorough in identifying which tools we already have vs which we need to add.
