## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Initialize the AI Power Rankings project for optimal use with Claude Code and Claude MPM. Perform a comprehensive project analysis and create/update documentation with clear priority-based organization.

## Project Context
- Location: /Users/masa/Projects/managed/ai-power-ranking
- Type: Next.js web application for AI technology rankings and news aggregation
- Stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- Data: JSON file-based storage system

## Required Tasks

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyze existing project structure and configurations
- Review current CLAUDE.md and documentation
- Identify gaps in single-path workflows
- Check for existing tool configurations

### 2. Update CLAUDE.md with Priority Organization
Update the existing CLAUDE.md with:
- 🎯 Priority Index with 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 IMPORTANT, 🟢 STANDARD, ⚪ OPTIONAL sections
- Reorganize existing instructions by priority
- Ensure single-path principle for all operations (ONE way to do ANYTHING)
- Add clear commands for build, test, deploy operations
- Include TrackDown integration instructions
- Reference all existing documentation files

### 3. Single-Path Standards Implementation
- Document THE ONE command for each operation:
  - Building: `pnpm run build`
  - Testing: `pnpm run ci:local`
  - Deployment: `pnpm run pre-deploy && vercel deploy`
  - Development: `pnpm run dev:pm2`
- Remove any conflicting or duplicate workflows
- Ensure consistency across all documentation

### 4. Tool Configuration Review
- Verify existing linting setup (ESLint, Prettier)
- Check TypeScript configuration
- Review test framework setup
- Document pre-commit hooks if needed

### 5. Memory System Enhancement
- Check `.claude-mpm/memories/` directory
- Update PM and agent memory files with project-specific knowledge
- Document memory usage patterns in CLAUDE.md

### 6. Create DEVELOPER.md
Create a comprehensive developer guide with:
- Technical architecture overview
- Code structure and organization
- API documentation for all endpoints
- Component hierarchy
- Data flow patterns
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization guidelines

### 7. Holistic Organization Review
After completing all tasks:
- Reorganize all content by priority
- Validate completeness of documentation
- Ensure single-path principle throughout
- Add meta-instructions for maintenance
- Cross-reference all documentation files

## Success Criteria
- CLAUDE.md updated with clear priority rankings
- Single-path workflows documented for all operations
- All existing documentation integrated and referenced
- Memory system properly configured
- DEVELOPER.md created with technical details
- No conflicting instructions or duplicate workflows

## Important Notes
- Build on existing documentation, don't replace it
- Maintain all TrackDown integration instructions
- Keep all agent configuration references
- Preserve existing workflow that works well
- Test all documented commands to ensure they work

Start by analyzing the current project setup, then systematically update documentation following the priority-based organization system.
