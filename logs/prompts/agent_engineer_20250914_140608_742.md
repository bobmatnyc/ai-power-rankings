## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Add a database connection indicator to the admin dashboard that shows which database environment is being connected to (development/production) and the connection status.

Tasks to complete:

1. **Create a new API endpoint** to get database connection info:
   - Create `/api/admin/db-status` route
   - Return: database name, host, connection status, environment (dev/prod)
   - Parse the DATABASE_URL to extract the database name and host
   - Don't expose sensitive info like passwords

2. **Add a database status component** to the UnifiedAdminDashboard:
   - Add it at the top of the dashboard, above the tabs
   - Show: 
     - Database environment (Development/Production)
     - Database name (e.g., "neondb")
     - Host (partial, e.g., "ep-bold-sunset...")
     - Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
     - Use a green dot for connected, red for disconnected
   - Make it a subtle info bar, not too prominent

3. **Style the indicator**:
   - Use a card or alert component
   - Include database icon
   - Show green badge for development, orange/red for production
   - Make it collapsible or dismissible if needed

4. **Security considerations**:
   - Only show partial host information (first part of the hostname)
   - Never expose passwords or full connection strings
   - Only accessible to authenticated admin users

Example display:
```
🗄️ Database: Development | neondb | ep-bold-sunset... | ● Connected
```

Location: /Users/masa/Projects/managed/ai-power-ranking/src/components/admin/unified-admin-dashboard.tsx

The indicator should load when the admin dashboard loads and show the current database connection information.
