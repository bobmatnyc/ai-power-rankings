AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: qa
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:21:04 | Auto-updated by: qa -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Task: Validate live production deployment at aipowerranking.com
Agent: QA

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Comprehensive validation of production deployment
  Inputs:
    - Production URL: https://aipowerranking.com
    - Database: PostgreSQL with migrated data
    - Environment: Vercel production
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - All pages load without errors
    - Database queries return correct data
    - SEO meta tags present
    - Performance metrics acceptable
    - Security headers configured
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Test production site and provide results
  Constraints:
    Performance: Page load < 3 seconds
    Security: HTTPS enforced
  Verification: Provide test results with screenshots or data

Production validation checklist:
1. Homepage loads with rankings data
2. Tools page shows 42 tools
3. News page displays articles
4. Rankings API returns current data
5. Internationalization works (redirects to /en/)
6. Mobile responsiveness
7. SEO tags and OpenGraph images
8. Performance metrics (Lighthouse score)

Return comprehensive validation report with pass/fail for each check.
