INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Perform a comprehensive security review before pushing to origin. This is MANDATORY before any git push operation.

Requirements:
1. Check all staged files for hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets
2. Look for patterns like: sk-, api_, token_, password, secret, key
3. Check for database connection strings with embedded credentials
4. Review any .env files or configuration files
5. Ensure no production database URLs are exposed
6. Verify no private keys or certificates are included

Scan the following patterns:
- API keys (AWS, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Database credentials
- Private keys and certificates
- Webhook URLs with tokens
- Service account credentials

Return a detailed report of findings and whether it's safe to push.
