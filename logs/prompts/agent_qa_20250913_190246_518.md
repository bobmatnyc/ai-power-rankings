## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Please verify and test the complete article management system that was just implemented. The system should support:

1. **Test Article Ingestion**:
   - Test the dry run feature at POST /api/admin/articles/ingest with dry_run=true
   - Use sample text: "OpenAI's GPT-5 shows remarkable improvements over GPT-4, with 95% accuracy on coding benchmarks. Claude 3.5 and Gemini Ultra are also competing strongly in the AI race."
   - Verify the dry run returns preview without saving to database

2. **Test Complete Submission**:
   - Submit the same article with dry_run=false
   - Verify it gets saved to the database
   - Check that the article appears in GET /api/admin/articles

3. **Test Article Management**:
   - Test updating article text (PATCH /api/admin/articles/[id])
   - Test the recalculate endpoint (POST /api/admin/articles/[id]/recalculate)
   - Test deletion with rollback (DELETE /api/admin/articles/[id])

4. **Verify UI Integration**:
   - Check that the Articles tab appears in /admin
   - Verify the ArticleManagement component is rendering

5. **Database Verification**:
   - Confirm the articles table exists in the database
   - Check article_rankings_changes table
   - Verify article_processing_logs table

The API is running at http://localhost:3000

Please provide actual test results with real API calls and responses. Show evidence that all features are working correctly.
