## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The admin authentication endpoint at /api/admin/auth is returning "Invalid request body" when receiving valid JSON. 

Current issue:
- POST to /api/admin/auth with `{"password":"AIPowerRankings2025!"}` returns 400 "Invalid request body"
- The JSON parsing is failing even though the JSON is valid
- This happens both locally and in production

Please:
1. Investigate why the JSON parsing is failing
2. Fix the issue to properly handle the JSON request body
3. Ensure the authentication works with the password "AIPowerRankings2025!"
4. Test the solution thoroughly
5. Make sure it works with Next.js 15

The endpoint should:
- Accept POST requests with JSON body containing a password field
- Return 200 with success message when password is correct
- Return 401 when password is wrong
- Return 400 only for truly invalid JSON
