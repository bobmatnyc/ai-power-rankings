## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with python, javascript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: types, tools, power, methodology

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel (production on main branch)
- **PM2 Integration**: Use pnpm run dev:pm2 for process management
- **Cache Generation**: Always run pnpm run cache:generate before deploy
- **Pre-deploy Script**: pnpm run pre-deploy validates everything
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backups before major data operations


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Task: Deploy AI Power Rankings to Vercel production
Agent: Ops

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Deploy application to Vercel production with PostgreSQL enabled
  Inputs:
    - Production build completed and tested
    - Vercel environment variables configured
    - Database migrated with 42 tools, 313 news, 31 rankings
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - Deployment completes with exit code 0
    - Production URL accessible
    - Database connections working
    - Environment variables applied
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Deploy and verify deployment URL
  Constraints:
    Security: Use production branch only
    Architecture: PostgreSQL database enabled
  Verification: Provide deployment URL and status

Deployment steps:
1. Ensure git repository is clean
2. Deploy to Vercel production: vercel --prod
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Verify production URL is accessible
5. Test database connectivity on production
6. Provide deployment summary with URL

Return deployment status with production URL and verification results.
