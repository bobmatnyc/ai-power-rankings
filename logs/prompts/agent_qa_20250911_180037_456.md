## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with react, typescript) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: rankings, types, methodology, admin

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **Testing Commands**: pnpm run test, type-check, lint, ci:local
- **JSON Validation**: All data files must be valid JSON
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, 100% type safety required
- **Pre-deploy Checks**: Always run pnpm run pre-deploy before production
- **Data Integrity**: Validate rankings scores (0-100), dates (ISO 8601)


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Verify that the admin interface now works without OAuth authentication in local deployment.

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
1. Direct Admin Access:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3002/admin (or appropriate port)
   - Verify page loads directly without signin redirect
   - Check that UnifiedAdminDashboard renders properly
   - Confirm no authentication errors appear

2. API Endpoint Testing:
   - Test news analysis endpoint without auth headers
   - Test rankings preview endpoint without auth
   - Test rankings commit endpoint without auth
   - Test version history endpoint without auth
   - Test rollback endpoint without auth
   - Verify all return successful responses

3. Complete Workflow Testing:
   - Upload a test news article (URL or text)
   - Verify AI analysis works
   - Check ranking preview generation
   - Test committing new rankings
   - Verify version history displays
   - Test rollback functionality

4. Environment Detection:
   - Confirm auth bypass only works locally
   - Verify logs show "Bypassing auth for local development"
   - Check that production flag would require auth

5. UI Functionality:
   - Test all tabs in the admin dashboard
   - Verify news upload form works
   - Check ranking preview display
   - Test version history viewer
   - Confirm subscriber email viewer works

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Admin page loads without authentication
- [ ] All API endpoints respond successfully
- [ ] Complete admin workflow functions properly
- [ ] No authentication errors or redirects
- [ ] UI components render and work correctly

Please run comprehensive tests and provide evidence that:
- OAuth has been successfully removed for local deployment
- All admin functionality works without authentication
- The system correctly detects local environment
- Production security is maintained
