Task: Perform security audit before production deployment
Agent: Security

Structural Requirements:
  Objective: Audit all credentials and sensitive configurations before deployment
  Inputs:
    - Environment files: .env.local, .env.production, .env.production.local
    - Vercel environment variables already configured
    - Database credentials in use
  Falsifiable Success Criteria:
    - No credentials hardcoded in committed files
    - All sensitive variables properly encrypted in Vercel
    - Database connections use secure SSL
    - No exposed API keys in client-side code
    - Git repository clean of secrets
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Scan all files and provide security report
  Constraints:
    Security: Zero tolerance for credential leaks
    Architecture: Environment-based configuration only
  Verification: Provide detailed security scan results

Audit scope:
1. Scan all source files for hardcoded credentials
2. Verify .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
3. Check that production environment variables are set in Vercel
4. Validate database connection uses SSL
5. Ensure API keys are server-side only
6. Review authentication configuration

Return a security assessment with any issues that need resolution before deployment.
