# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-07 16:00:35 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Context
ai-power-rankings: node_js (with typescript, react) single page application
- Main modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml
- Uses: @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox, @radix-ui/react-collapsible
- Testing: @testing-library/jest-dom
- Key patterns: Async Programming

## Project Architecture
- Single Page Application with node_js implementation
- Main directories: src, docs
- Core modules: types, contexts, app, app/rss.xml

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Node.js project: use async/await, ES6+ features
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- React patterns: component composition, hooks usage
- Project uses: Async Programming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pnpm for dependency management
- Write tests using @testing-library/jest-dom
- Use build tools: test, test:watch
- Key config files: package.json

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for ai-power-rankings domain -->
- Key project terms: tools, about, rankings, admin
- Focus on implementation patterns, coding standards, and best practices
- Ensure test coverage using @testing-library/jest-dom

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid callback hell - use async/await consistently
- Don't commit node_modules - ensure .gitignore is correct
- Don't skip test isolation - ensure tests can run independently

## Integration Points
- REST API integration pattern

## Performance Considerations
- Leverage event loop - avoid blocking operations
- Use streams for large data processing
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: node_js, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- API patterns: REST API
- Key dependencies: @builder.io/partytown, @hookform/resolvers, @marsidev/react-turnstile, @next/third-parties
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/SITEMAP-SUBMISSION.md

## Recent Learnings
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->
- **August 2025 API Consolidation**: Reduced 8 separate endpoints to 1 unified handler
- **Code Reduction**: Achieved 30% reduction through aggressive refactoring
- **JSON Storage**: Standardized on file-based storage with validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Generate static JSON files for performance
- **TrackDown Integration**: All work must link to local tickets in /trackdown/


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Fix the tool detection issues in the article ingestion system. The problem is that the LLM extracts generic model names (like "GPT-4", "Claude") but our database has specific product names (like "ChatGPT Canvas", "Claude Code").

Requirements:
1. Update the LLM prompt in /src/lib/services/article-ingestion.service.ts to better guide tool extraction toward product names
2. Add a tool alias mapping system to normalize extracted names to database names
3. Implement fuzzy matching for tool detection
4. Add specific mappings for:
   - "GPT-4", "GPT-5", "GPT-5-Codex" → appropriate tools
   - "Claude", "Claude 3.5" → "Claude Code" 
   - "Replit" → "Replit Agent"
   - "Cognition", "Cognition AI" → "Devin"
   - "Codex", "OpenAI Codex" → "OpenAI Codex CLI"
   - "Gemini" → "Google Gemini Code Assist"

Test your implementation to ensure:
- Tool extraction correctly maps variations to database names
- The system can handle new tools that don't exist yet (like GPT-5-Codex)
- Fuzzy matching works for partial matches

Make the changes minimal and focused on fixing the detection issue.
