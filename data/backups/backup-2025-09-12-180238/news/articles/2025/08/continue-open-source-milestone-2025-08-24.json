  "title": "Continue Reaches 20K GitHub Stars, Launches Community Hub for Custom AI Agents",
  "content": "<p>Continue, the open-source AI coding assistant platform, has reached a significant milestone of 20,000 GitHub stars, reflecting growing developer interest in customizable, open-source alternatives to proprietary AI coding tools. The achievement coincides with the launch of Continue 1.0 and a new community hub for sharing custom AI coding agents.</p>\n<p>The new community hub enables developers to create, share, and discover custom AI coding assistants tailored to specific languages, frameworks, or development workflows. This positions Continue as the antithesis of proprietary 'black box' AI assistant providers, fostering an open ecosystem for collaborative development.</p>\n<p>'Instead of everybody building their own closed-source AI code assistant, we're creating an open architecture where all of us can work together to create the building blocks people need,' said Continue's team. The platform now supports centralized configurations and secure credential management for enterprise teams.</p>\n<p>Continue's approach allows developers to connect with any AI model and development environment, providing full control over their AI coding experience. The platform includes both open-source IDE extensions and a CLI tool, enabling teams to build shared custom AI coding agents with customizable tools.</p>\n<p>The milestone reflects a broader trend toward open-source AI development tools, with developers increasingly seeking alternatives that offer transparency, customization, and freedom from vendor lock-in. Continue's growth demonstrates strong demand for developer-controlled AI assistance.</p>",
