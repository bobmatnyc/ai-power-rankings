  "title": "Cursor Releases Critical Security Patches for MCP Vulnerabilities",
  "content": "<p>Cursor has released version 1.4.1, addressing critical security vulnerabilities related to Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations that could have allowed remote code execution through malicious file swaps. The update follows responsible disclosure of two vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2025-54135 and CVE-2025-54136.</p>\n<p>The MCPoison vulnerability (CVE-2025-54136, CVSS score: 7.2) exploited how Cursor handled modifications to MCP server configurations. The patch now requires explicit user approval every time an entry in the MCP configuration file is modified, preventing silent malicious changes.</p>\n<p>A second vulnerability (CVE-2025-54135, CVSS score: 8.6) related to auto-run mode circumvention has also been patched. Cursor has deprecated the previous denylist-based protections in favor of a more secure allowlist approach, providing stronger security guarantees.</p>\n<p>Alongside security fixes, version 1.4.1 includes performance improvements for large codebases. The read file function now handles full files without the previous 2MB cap, the list function can explore full directory trees in one call, and grep matching has been improved with reduced noise.</p>\n<p>Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, emphasized their commitment to security as the platform continues its rapid growth, now serving over 1 million developers following their recent $900 million funding round at a $9 billion valuation.</p>",
