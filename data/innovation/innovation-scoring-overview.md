## How We Track Innovation

Innovation scores are evaluated monthly based on:

- Feature releases and technical announcements
- Benchmark performance on novel tasks
- Developer community adoption of new paradigms
- Industry impact and competitive responses
- Academic papers and technical documentation

## Why Innovation Matters

While market traction and technical performance are important, innovation scoring helps identify:

- Tools that will define the future of development
- Early movers in emerging categories
- Potential disruption before it shows in adoption metrics
- Long-term leaders vs. short-term winners

Innovation scores naturally decay over time as breakthrough features become table stakes, ensuring our rankings always highlight the cutting edge of AI coding technology.
