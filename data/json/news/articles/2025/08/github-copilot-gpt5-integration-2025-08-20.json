  "title": "GitHub Copilot Integrates GPT-5 in Public Preview with 40% Reasoning Improvement",
  "content": "<p>GitHub has announced the integration of OpenAI's GPT-5 model into GitHub Copilot, now available in public preview for all paid plans. The integration brings substantial improvements in reasoning capabilities, code quality, and user experience, marking a major advancement in AI-assisted development.</p>\n<p>GPT-5 delivers a 40% improvement in reasoning capabilities compared to GPT-4, with particular excellence in handling end-to-end complex coding tasks and large implementations with minimal prompting. The model introduces a revolutionary 'thinking' mode that provides clear, upfront explanations of its actions before generating code.</p>\n<p>The enhanced agentic capabilities make GPT-5 a true coding collaborator, capable of understanding project context, anticipating developer needs, and providing more accurate suggestions. Early adopters report significant productivity gains, especially in complex refactoring and architectural design tasks.</p>\n<p>GPT-5 is accessible through GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com, Visual Studio Code (in Agent, Ask, and Edit modes), and GitHub Mobile via the chat model picker. Users can seamlessly switch between GPT-5 and other available models including Claude Opus 4.1, providing flexibility in choosing the right AI assistant for specific tasks.</p>\n<p>GitHub has also implemented enhanced security scanning capabilities, with the remote GitHub MCP server now automatically scanning all tool call inputs in public repositories, blocking calls when exposed secrets are detected.</p>",
