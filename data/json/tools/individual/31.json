    "summary": "Specification-driven AI IDE that creates production-ready applications from detailed requirements",
    "description": "Kiro is a next-generation AI IDE that transforms software development by implementing a specification-first methodology. Unlike 'vibe coding' tools that generate code from casual prompts, Kiro requires developers to think through requirements, generating comprehensive specification documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) before writing a single line of code. This approach bridges the gap between AI-assisted development and enterprise-grade software engineering, ensuring production-ready outputs from the start.",
