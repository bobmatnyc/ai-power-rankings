# AI Coding Tools Market: Fact-Check and Intelligence Report

## Critical Corrections to Original Claims

### **1. Ranking Claims Are Largely Inaccurate**

**GitHub Copilot #19→#1 Movement**: **FALSE** - No evidence supports this claim. Current July 2025 rankings from [LogRocket show Claude 4 Sonnet leading at 80.2% SWE-bench performance](https://blog.logrocket.com/ai-dev-tool-power-rankings-july-2025/), not GitHub Copilot. The AI Power Rankings v7.0 methodology (30% adoption, 25% performance, etc.) could not be verified.

**Devin #3→#19 Drop**: **FALSE** - While Devin's 13.86% SWE-bench score is accurate, the specific ranking movement claim lacks verification.

**"Claude Code" Confusion**: The 72.7% score is **real but misattributed** - it belongs to [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4), not a separate "Claude Code" product. Claude Sonnet 4 actually achieved 80.2% with parallel compute.

**GitHub Copilot 56% Score**: **UNVERIFIED** - No official source confirms this SWE-bench score for GitHub Copilot.

### **2. GitHub Copilot's Agentic Evolution Is Real and Significant**

The new capabilities are **100% verified** and represent a major shift:
- **[Agent Mode](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/)** (GA April 2025): Synchronous, real-time autonomous programming with terminal integration
- **[Coding Agent](https://github.com/newsroom/press-releases/coding-agent-for-github-copilot)** (Preview May 2025): Asynchronous, cloud-based development handling complete issue-to-PR workflows
- **Self-healing error correction**: Automatic detection and iterative problem resolution confirmed
- **Multi-step task execution**: Full autonomous workflow capabilities verified

CEO Thomas Dohmke called it ["where developers collaborate with agents in a configurable, steerable, and verifiable way"](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/) at Microsoft Build 2025.

### **3. Amazon Kiro Is Real - Launched July 14, 2025**

**Confirmed as legitimate**: [AWS Kiro entered public preview on July 14, 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/aws-launches-kiro-ai-coding-program.html), with CEO Andy Jassy stating it "has a chance to transform how developers build software."

**Key verified features**:
- **[Specification-driven development to combat "vibe coding chaos"](https://www.geekwire.com/2025/amazon-targets-vibe-coding-chaos-with-new-kiro-ai-software-development-tool/)**
- Three-stage workflow: Requirements Generation → Technical Design → Task Implementation
- Built on Code OSS with Claude Sonnet 4.0 as primary model
- [Currently free during preview with waitlist due to high demand](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4026642/aws-imposes-caps-on-kiro-usage-introduces-waitlist-for-new-users.html)
- Cloud-agnostic, no AWS account required

### **4. Technical Claims Mixed Accuracy**

**Claude Code 529 Errors**: **VERIFIED** - [Extensive GitHub issues document ongoing infrastructure problems](https://www.restack.io/p/sweep-sweep-claude-ai-returns-error-529-overloaded) affecting even $200/month Max plan subscribers

**Windsurf $3B Acquisition**: **FALSE/OUTDATED** - [The OpenAI deal collapsed in July 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/07/11/the-exclusivity-on-openais-3-billion-acquisition-for-coding-startup-windsfurf-has-expired/). Google DeepMind hired Windsurf's leadership team for ~$2.4B instead

**Gemini Code Assist 2M Context**: **PARTIALLY TRUE** - [The 2M token window exists for Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/google-unleashes-2m-token-context-code-execution-gemini-developers/) but is still rolling out to Code Assist specifically
