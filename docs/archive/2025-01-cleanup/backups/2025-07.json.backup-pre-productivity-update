    "title": "AI coding tools may not speed up every developer, study shows",
    "summary": "A new study by the non-profit METR found that AI coding tools like Cursor Pro and GitHub Copilot do not necessarily improve productivity for experienced developers. In a controlled trial with 16 developers completing 246 tasks, using AI tools actually increased task completion time by 19%, contrary to the developers' expectation of a 24% speedup. The study highlights that AI coding tools may not universally accelerate workflows as widely believed.",
