# AI Power Rankings Monthly Update - Style Guide

## Companion to LinkedIn Newsletter Style Guide

---

## What This Format Is

A brief monthly update announcing changes to aipowerranking.com—new tools added, ranking shifts, methodology improvements, and notable market movements captured in the data.

**Purpose:** Keep the audience informed about platform evolution while reinforcing its value as a decision-support tool

**Cadence:** Monthly, timed to significant platform updates

**Length:** 400-600 words (half the weekly roundup)

**Tone:** Informational with light strategic framing—closer to a changelog with executive context than a full analysis piece

---

## Core Principles for This Format

### 1. Update First, Analysis Second

This isn't the venue for deep strategic analysis—that's the weekly newsletter. Lead with what changed on the platform. Strategic implications are supporting context, not the main event.

### 2. Signal the Work

Monthly updates demonstrate the platform is actively maintained and improving. Each update should make clear that research and evaluation are ongoing. "We added 4 new tools this month" signals value. "The AI market continues to evolve" signals nothing.

### 3. Make It Scannable

Readers should grasp what changed in 30 seconds. Use clear sections, specific numbers, and tool names. Save the narrative for longer formats.

### 4. Connect to Decisions

Even brief updates should answer: "Why should I care?" A new tool added matters because it fills a gap in the rankings. A methodology change matters because it improves accuracy for vendor selection.

---

## Structure

### Opening (2-3 sentences)

State what this is and the time period covered. No throat-clearing.

**Example:** "Here's what changed on AI Power Rankings in January 2026. Four new tools, two methodology updates, and some notable ranking shifts worth flagging."

### New Additions Section

List new tools added with one-line context on why they matter.

**Format:**

- **[Tool Name]** — Brief description of category/positioning. Why it earned inclusion.

**Example:**

- **Augment Code** — Enterprise-focused agent with 200K context window. Added after sustained adoption growth and enterprise customer validation.
- **Amazon Kiro** — Specification-driven development platform. Represents Amazon's serious entry into the agentic coding space.

Keep to 4-6 additions maximum. If more were added, group by category.

### Ranking Movements (Optional)

Only include if movements are significant enough to warrant executive attention. Don't manufacture drama around minor shifts.

**When to include:**

- A tool moved 5+ positions
- A major vendor entered or exited a tier
- A methodology change caused systematic repositioning

**Format:** "[Tool] moved from [position] to [position] following [specific reason]."

### Methodology Updates (When Applicable)

Brief explanation of what changed and why it improves the rankings.

**Example:** "Updated security weighting to reflect recent CVE disclosures affecting multiple major tools. Security now carries 15% of total score, up from 10%."

### What's Coming (1-2 sentences)

Optional preview of next month's focus areas. Creates continuity.

**Example:** "February will add coverage of the emerging multi-agent orchestration tools as that category matures."

### Closing

Attribution and pointer to the full newsletter for deeper analysis.

**Standard closing:** "For strategic analysis of what these developments mean for your organization, subscribe to the [full AI Power Rankings newsletter](https://claude.ai/chat/link). Detailed tool evaluations and methodology available at [aipowerranking.com](https://claude.ai/chat/link)."

## Mechanics

### Length

- 400-600 words total
- 8-12 minutes to read should feel like 3-4 minutes

### Sections

- 4-5 sections maximum
- Clear bold headers
- Bullet lists for tool additions
- Single paragraphs elsewhere

### Links

- 2-4 links maximum
- Link to specific tool pages on aipowerranking.com
- Link to full newsletter
- No external links unless essential

### Numbers

- Specific counts: "4 new tools" not "several additions"
- Specific dates: "added January 15" not "recently added"
- Specific metrics when relevant: "200K context window" not "large context"

---

## Voice for This Format

### More informational, less advisory

Weekly newsletters make calls and push toward decisions. Monthly updates inform and demonstrate ongoing value. The judgment is embedded in what you chose to add/rank, not in explicit recommendations.

### Efficient, not terse

Brief doesn't mean cold. Maintain warmth through:

- First person where natural ("I added..." or "We updated...")
- Light context that shows you're evaluating, not just listing
- Occasional aside about why something matters

### Platform-proud without selling

You built this. It's useful. Let that show without making the update feel like marketing.

**Good:** "The rankings now cover 47 tools across 6 categories—the most comprehensive evaluation I'm aware of in this space."

**Avoid:** "AI Power Rankings continues to be the definitive resource for..."

---

## Prohibited in This Format

### Death list applies

Same language prohibitions as the main newsletter. No "delve," "robust," "landscape" (except in explicit competitive context), etc.

### No deep analysis

Save strategic implications for the weekly newsletter. If you're writing more than two sentences about what a development means, it belongs in a different format.

### No filler

"The AI coding tools market continues to evolve rapidly" adds nothing. Every sentence should convey specific information.

### No apologies for brevity

Don't explain that this is a brief update or promise deeper analysis later. Just deliver the update.

**AI Power Rankings: January 2026 Update**

Here's what changed on AI Power Rankings this month. Four new tools, one methodology update, and a notable shift in the enterprise tier.

**New Additions**

- **Continue** — Open-source alternative gaining traction with teams prioritizing transparency. 48,000 GitHub stars and accelerating.
- **Devin 2.0** — Cognition's updated autonomous agent with 83% efficiency improvement over v1. Price dropped from $500/month to $20.
- **Claude Code Extensions** — Native VS Code and JetBrains integrations. Evaluated separately from CLI version given different use cases.

**Ranking Movement**

Claude Code moved from #3 to #2 in the overall rankings following the May general availability release and documented enterprise adoption. GitHub Copilot retains the top position on distribution and ecosystem integration.

**Methodology Update**

Security weighting increased from 10% to 15% of total score following Q1 2025 CVE disclosures affecting Cursor, Anthropic MCP, and Microsoft Copilot. Tools with unpatched critical vulnerabilities now receive automatic tier penalties.

**What's Next**

February will add multi-agent orchestration tools (claude-flow, claude-orchestrator) as that category matures beyond experimental status.
