# TrackDown Project Tracking Implementation Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of a TrackDown-style markdown-based project tracking system within a Git repository. The approach centralizes project management artifacts in versioned markdown files, enabling distributed team collaboration while maintaining simplicity and tool independence.

**Key Benefits:**
- Version-controlled project history with full audit trail
- Offline-capable project management 
- Tool-agnostic implementation using standard markdown
- Seamless integration with existing development workflows
- Zero external dependencies or hosted services required

## System Architecture

### Core Philosophy

The TrackDown approach treats project management artifacts as code, storing all tracking information in markdown files within the project repository. This enables the same collaborative patterns used for source code—branching, merging, reviewing, and versioning—to apply to project management.

## Core Components

### 1. BACKLOG.md - Central Tracking File

The backlog serves as the single source of truth for all project work items. Each item follows a standardized format with YAML frontmatter for metadata and markdown for descriptions.

#### Structure Template

```markdown
---
title: "Project Backlog"

jobs:
  validate-project-files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Validate Backlog Format
        run: |
          python trackdown/scripts/backlog-validator.py
          
      - name: Generate Metrics Report
        run: |
          python trackdown/scripts/metrics-generator.py
          
      - name: Check for Required Fields
        run: |
          # Ensure all stories have required metadata
          grep -L "Priority:" trackdown/BACKLOG.md && exit 1 || exit 0
```

## Reporting and Metrics

### Automated Metrics Collection

**Velocity Tracking:**
- Story points completed per sprint
- Cycle time from "Ready" to "Done"
- Lead time from creation to completion

**Quality Metrics:**
- Defect rate (bugs per story points delivered)
- Rework rate (stories returning to earlier status)
- Sprint commitment accuracy

**Team Metrics:**
- Individual contribution tracking
- Collaboration patterns via commit authors
- Knowledge distribution across work items

### Dashboard Generation

Create a simple HTML dashboard from markdown data:

```python
# scripts/trackdown/dashboard-generator.py
def generate_dashboard():
    """Generate HTML dashboard from project markdown files"""
    
    # Parse current backlog state
    backlog_data = parse_backlog_file()
    
    # Calculate key metrics
    velocity = calculate_velocity()
    burndown = generate_burndown_data()
    
    # Generate HTML report
    html_template = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Project Dashboard</title>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Project Status Dashboard</h1>
        
        <div class="metrics">
            <div class="metric">
                <h3>Current Sprint Velocity</h3>
                <p class="value">{velocity} story points</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="metric">
                <h3>Stories Completed</h3>
                <p class="value">{completed}/{total}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chart">
            <canvas id="burndownChart"></canvas>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    """.format(
        velocity=velocity,
        completed=backlog_data['completed_count'],
        total=backlog_data['total_count']
    )
    
    with open('trackdown/dashboard.html', 'w') as f:
        f.write(html_template)
```
